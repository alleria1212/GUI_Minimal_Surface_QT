# GUI_Minimal_Surface_QT
GUI for numerical simulations of a minimal surface

Numerical algorithms: Newton Methods + Finite Difference 

Features:
- unique file extension to save/load the results
- dco data types for the computation
- Optimisations (for Example: Estimation of a good starting vector for the newton method)
- Sparse Matrix/Eigen library
- Worker Thread for the calculation + Progressbar + instationary Simulation


You can find a short overview in the file: Sep_Presentation.pdf
