# GUI_Minimal_Surface_QT
GUI for numerical simulations of a minimal surface
Numerical algorithms: Newton Methods + Finite Difference 


Sourcecode + library can be found at
GUI_Minimal_Surface_QT/minimalsurface



Features:
- unique file extension to save/load the results
- dco data types for the computation
- Optimisations (for Example: Estimation of a good starting vector for the newton method)
- Sparse Matrix/Eigen library
- Worker Thread for the calculation + Progressbar  + instationary simulation
- avoided to use a lot of branches (pipelining)


You can find a short overview in the file: Sep_Presentation.pdf

For more detailed information, look at the Developer & Analysis Document:
